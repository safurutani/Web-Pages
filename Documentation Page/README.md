For this project I decided to create a reference page for selecting data from dataframes using Pandas in python for people who are learning the library for data analysis. 

There is so much documentation for this library and I wanted to provide a brief guide without overwhelming the user with every single possibility. Since I based my information off sparkbyexamples.com, I linked to the relevant source after every section as well as at the end in my reference section.

I included the python file with the dataframe I created for the sake of having my own example from which I could easily copy the output and include on the web page. The code to use is has a yellow background while the output code has a light white-green background so it is easy to differentiate. The code itself doesn't output that which I tried to distinguish by saying gets rather than outputs because there is no print statement included (which would've been more clutter).

The 5 sections I chose to include were: Selecting Rows, Selecting Columns, Selecting a Cell Value, Dropping Data, and Selecting Based on a Value. I ensured to provide plenty of examples as well as a little bit of parameter explanation within the Dropping Data section.

The side menu was a big part of the project. It stays on the left side of the viewport until the width gets too small. The viewer can quickly jump to each selection method from here. When the screen size is too small, the whole menu can still be viewed vertically but it instead is at the top of the page. However when you scroll it doesn't stay at the top or else it takes up too much screen space. I also decided to use a color gradient for the background of both the menu and main body.
