## Dynamic Sizing Changes
The navigation bar remains along the top of the web page unless the viewport is less than 515px. It incorporates an underlining animation when hovering over an option.

At viewport with a width of 940px, the header gets smaller with the navigation bar wrapping underneath the logo and name. The features condense into a 3x2 layout instead of 2x3 and the icons appear above the info instead of to the side. 

At viewport with a width of 515px, the header gets smaller and only includes the logo and name. The navigation bar disappears. The features becomes a single column while still displaying icons.
No matter the size, the image and iframes adjust to the width.
